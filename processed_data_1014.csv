"Sciences ,Laboratory ,R&D",A*STAR RESEARCH ENTITIES,Contract ,"About the Institute for Infocomm Research (I²R)The Institute for Infocomm Research (I²R) is a member of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) family and is Singapore’s largest ICT research institute. Our strategic thrusts are in the spheres of intelligence, communications and media and our research capabilities are in shared sensor networks, public-public/public-private data-sharing platform, big data analytics and visualization solutions. For more information about I2R, please visit www.i2r.a-star.edu.sg. We are looking for strong candidates in the field of Artificial intelligence and deep learning, with an interest in working on both fundamental algorithms in large-scale machine learning or deep learning, and also applying it to practical problems in vertical domains.The position, based within the Program in Artificial Intelligence at I2R, entails working closely with a highly interdisciplinary team of researchers with training from leading universities like MIT, Stanford and CMU. Listed below are problems of interest in the Deep Learning 2.0 project:Multimodal Deep Learning:.Towards effective learning from heterogeneous data sources. Currently, deep learning is applied in various areas such as visual computing, speech recognition, text mining, etc. In each area, the learning model is trained with large amounts of data in isolation. A multimodal learning approach from heterogeneous data sources, including video, speech, text, etc. is necessary to achieve breakthrough in performance.Unsupervised Deep Learning:.Towards 10X fewer labeled samples. Labeling large amounts of training data is one of the most time-consuming steps in the deep learning pipeline, and is often not feasible. The aim is to achieve the same performance with 10x fewer labeled training samples. This is a strong step in the direction of unsupervised deep learning, where representations are learnt with large amounts of unlabeled unstructured data.Deep Learning on Embedded Devices:.Towards 100X smaller models. Current deep learning models have 10s of millions of neurons, making it infeasible for deployment on mobile and embedded hardware. The aim is to achieve models that are 100x smaller, with little loss in performance. This capability will also be critical for emerging neuromorphic platforms, where the number of spiking neurons is orders of magnitude smaller than in current state-of-the-art deep learning models.Online Deep Learning:.Towards Near Real Time (NRT) model updates. State-of-the-art deep learning models still take several days to train on expensive GPU infrastructure. A common problem is when new data (including new classes) are constantly added to an evolving, always-learning system. Algorithms to move towards real-time updates will be essential.Extreme Deep Learning:.Training 1B neural networks efficiently. The high model capacity of deep networks is why increasing amounts of data and model size improves performance. However, there are substantial challenges in hardware and algorithms challenges in training very large models efficiently. The aim is to address these challenges to achieve more efficient training.Deep Learning for Spoken Language Processing and Natural Language Understanding: Towards better modeling of human communication. Language technology has made great advances through deep learning in the past five years, penetrating fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. However, there are still numerous challenges that need to be addressed, ranging from the requirement of specialized linguistic resources to large amounts of annotated data, and to insufficient theoretical grounding in deep learning. This aim attempts to address challenges that are often overlooked by major commercial AI players.White-Box Deep Learning:.Towards interpretable and contextually informed models. Current deep learning models are largely black-boxes that are not informed by contextual relations and provide little intuition. Improved abilities to regulate the learning process, and interpret the resulting predictions will be essential for the next wave of AI applications -- especially for complex learning scenarios and applications involving critical decisions.Incorporating Knowledge Graphs into Deep Learning:.Towards better understanding of images. Current deep learning systems today have no real understanding of images, with output typically a bunch of bounding boxes, learnt using a large number of label or sentence-level associations. Knowledge graphs like the MIT Concept. Net will be used to understand higher-level semantics and relationships between entities, to improve classification accuracy.","Minimum Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, Statistics, Data Science intensive fields with expertise in one or more of the following areas:Large-scale machine learning.

"Environment ,Health   ...",Health Promotion Board,Full Time,"Strategy and Industry Engagement lead, Technology-Enabled National Healthy Population (TeNHP)The project is an endorsed Smart Nation initiative (first in a citizen-fronting deployable application space) and will involve the creation of a nation-wide platform to collect, through smart devices such as wearables, real-time and personalized biometric and wellness data. Such data, matched to clinical records, can create personalized applications, delivered through smart devices, that will help nudge our citizens to healthier behaviours; predict or even pre-empt medical situations like stroke, falls and heart attacks; and.improve chronic disease management and coordination of care across health,.social and.consumer entities. The platform is an open public-private one with government playing the role of a neutral and trusted data-broker to.multilateralise.data-sharing for health innovation and service delivery.This project has the ambition to create a step-improvement in health promotion and chronic disease management, pioneering capabilities with tech giants to front global-first co-innovation. It will also allow for the real time tracking of the Singapore population's health behaviours, and potentially give Government a much more accurate read of how the population responds to policy changes and allow for personalised services delivered at national scale. By providing a research platform for new medical interventions, it has the potential to accelerate the adoption of a whole range of clinical interventions. The project will involve a range private sector players coming in to use Singapore as a test bed to trial new products and services in precision health and medicine. Key technologies that are likely to be trialled in this project are health related wearable and sensor technology, big data analytics, machine learning, behavioural science, genomics and precision medicine.The Strategy and Industry Lead will assist the Coordinating Director to:Strategise, plan and formulate the vision, implementation strategy and roadmap (including workstreams, team structures, timelines and budgets) for TeNHP;Reach out, assess, prioritise and implement key partnerships with private sector leaders in technology and healthcare sector to participate on our platform.
